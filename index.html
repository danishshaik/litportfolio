								<h2>Standing Up</h2>
								<p>I'm usually a very straightforward person. I usually don't hide what I'm thinking, having said that, many times when I don't feel its right to voice my opinion.</p>

								<p> Let me tell you a story about when It feels right to voice my opinion. It was my tenth grade affirmative action debate. Like usual I came unprepared, contrary to my usual behavior during class discussions, and class debates I’m relatively mute. I know, shocker!, but in all honesty I’m a very shy person, I don’t enjoy being put on the spot, and being unprepared make those moments even more difficult. Regardless I was really into the topic and said something that was incredibly close minded about affirmative action. I said that people at our school have to be much smarter to get an A yet a childs “A” in Oakland is weighted higher in the eyes of a college. I voiced my opinion, got a lot of boo’s for the class but it was definitely worth it. The gratification of being able to convince some people, was definitely worth the uncomfortable position I was put in.</p>

								<h2>Friendship Journal</h2>

								<p>I met a friend a while back, at the beginning of 10th grade. He was new to the school , and sat awkwardly in the corner. I approached him in the corner of the gym. At first to me he seemed like a brilliant homes schooled kid, finally taking his stand in society. He held in his hand an AP Calc book which was an incredibly advanced math class. Regardless my first impressions of him were quiet, genius, and serial killer. 6 weeks past and I found out that he was in my math class now. Before I was a little intimidated by his intellect, but in reality he was just as dumb as the rest of us. We talked for a while everyday in P.E, we joked around and I realized later that he had skipped a grade so to poke fun at that fact my friends and I nicknamed him “freshman”, Over time we became pretty good friends, and he constantly helped me on my essays. Turns out he was pretty intelligent. Anyway I’m not very good at being sentimental, and just writing this makes me cringe. But I can honestly say that we have been good friends since then.</p>

								<h2>Moral Dilemma</h2>
								<p>A couple of weeks ago, I found myself in a very awkward situation. I had “left” my physics lab at home. This lab was worth a huge chunk of my grade, and not turning it in would mean a gigantic drop in my grade point average. One of my friends saw me in this moment of distress, and he offered his assistance. I only had 15 minutes to do the lab and the only way I would ever come close to finishing was if I took his lab and copied. I begged him for his paper, and out of sympathy he aided me. I quickly rushed through the problems and finished the lab with 5 minutes to spare. Content with my copying abilities and my finished lab I rushed off to my second period physics lab. I was inches from receiving credit for my lab when I realized that turning in this lab could affect both me and my friend, and a 0 would hurt me far less than if I got caught. I ended up not turning in the lab. Yes my grade suffered but in reality, turning it in wouldn’t have been worth putting my friends record in harms way.</p>

								<h2>Place of Refuge</h2>
								<p>I find refuge in my bedroom, I understand that your bedroom is extremely cliche and that everyone finds refuge for that my reasons for that are I assure you unique. My bedroom is a place of expressiveness for me. It’s dirty yes but its messy in a way that defines who I am. Every piece of my room is a result of my actions while there. My sheets being just slightly out of place and my bed laying comfortably in the corner. All a result of both my intuition and my jittery sleeping state. Regardless, my room is essentially a sacred place, where I can go when I am both mad at the world, or even when I am grateful.</p>

								<h2>Tenets of Transcendentalism</h2>
								<p>The origin of the honeymoon is not generally known.</p>

								<p>Insight - <i>Insight, do you need to be around nature. I am in complete disagreement with the Tenets of Transcendentalism, I don't think it is how you connect with yourself. In fact nature is something that draws me away from my self. Computer, and technology are where I find refuge. Nature pulls me away from that.</i></p>

								<p>Nature - <i>For me Nature is not at all something that helps me concentrate nor is it something that helps me come to peace with myself. On the contrary it is something that draws me away from my passion, being computer engineering. </i></p>

								<p>Truth - <i>Truth is definitely an essential part of transcendentalism for me at least. And not for the sake of others, but for the sake of yourself. In my book, being truthful to others is good, but irrelevant when it comes to Transcendentalism. What matters is truthfulness to yourself.</i></p>

								<p>Materialism - <i>Materialism is strongly forbidden and looked down upon according to the tenets of transcendentalism. I agree with this tenet in a sense however its extremely broad. I think that there is both positive materialism and destructive materialism. When materialism goes to an extent where is it only for the thrill of being materialistic thats when you know its destructive.</i></p>

								<p>Individualism - <i>Its human nature conform. Yet transcendentalism warns strongly against it. I strongly agree with this tenet. Individualism is what defines you and you shouldn’t let society take that away from you.</i></p>

								<h2>Dreams Reflection</h2>
								<p>Dreams are a way to fake reality, they are similar to hallucinogens in that they give an escape from reality. Honestly, I mean that in the most positive way possible. Dreams are essentially a way for you to become what you have always strived to become without the struggles and constraints of the real world. This makes dreams an extremely compelling part of the day. My dreams are generally about what I picture the future being like for me. And I enjoy them immensely. However I think intense dreaming, and sleeping just to dream is a little extreme. In the things they carried, Tim becomes obsessed with dreaming about Linda that he sleeps as much as possible just to live in the fantasized world where Linda is still alive. Gatsby’s dreams are all about Daisy, and he fantasizes about a life with Daisy. I think he became obsessed with his dream life, and nearly killed a man to achieve that same sense of status in his real life.</p>

								<h2>Object of Great Meaning</h2>
								<p>An object that defines me, at least at this moment would probably be my tablet. My nexus 7, this is probably something that I couldn’t live without. And honestly I’m unsure how I survived life before I had it. It allows me to be both productive and portable. It is the perfect screen size. And lets me use the functionality of the web, as well as the entertainment platform that is Android. My tablet comes with me nearly everywhere, It keeps me connected to the world and to my self. If that makes any sense. I love my nexus, and honestly life without it seems so distant and so drastic that just imagining it makes me cringe.</p>

								<h2>This I believe</h2>
								<p>So I spent a lot of time thinking about what on earth I was going to say today. And I thought about all the speeches I have ever heard in my entire life. And I realized that every good speech falls into one of two categories there are informational speeches were really smart people get on stage and tell you that A + B +C equals a good life. And there are motivational presentations where really successful people get on stage and tell you really funny stories about all the mistakes they made and all the hard lessons they learned on the long road to success. And I was really frustrated when I realized that I couldn’t give either one of those two speeches. On the one I’m not experienced or smart enough to have the slightest idea what the formula for success is, and if I did I would be making 10 billion dollars a year. And on the other hand I’m not successful enough to tell you funny stories about all the lessons I think I’ve learned because I have absolutely no idea if those lessons are going to ultimately result in success or if they are ultimately going to result in failure. So I procrastinated like crazy, and a couple of days ago I remembered the best presentation I’d ever heard was when Mark and Sean of Facebook came to De Anza and told us a story about how Facebook spent their first thousand days, A thousand days searching high and low for product market share I’ve never left a presentation more motivated more inspired in my entire life, but I had one problem with the presentation, one nagging thought that I just could not get out of my mind. It was that Mark and Sean and everyone else at facebook, they earned their right to come to De Anza and tell that story. But I couldn’t help but go home and wonder how many other people have persisted for a thousand days or maybe a hell of a lot longer and ultimately failed. And thats when I realized the one thing I can actually talk about today, the one thing I could tell you guys. I could tell you my story, the story of my life, and I could tell it with an honesty that successful people can’t. I can tell you the what I believe on the 999 day, the day before anyone knows if it will lead to a massive success or if it will lead to a spectacular failure.</p>

								<h2>Career Night Write-Up</h2>
								<p>At career night I attended the Engineering workshops, and after around 2 hours of listening to speeches about the aspects of engineering. And after thorough analysis of the situation, I have arrived to the conclusion that software engineering was the right fit for me. The speaker attended UC Berkeley and now works at facebook. I found his speech both inspiring and informative. The speaker talked about how internships at several smaller companies led him to land this job at facebook. He talked also about how facebook was an extremely. Lenient place to work at. He also made note of the fact that facebook heavily recruits from UC Berkeley. Anyway I feel as though I am giving this seminar too much credit. I was already hellbent on Software engineering, and the seminar just reinforced that. I guess that I have always been interested in computer engineering, but the seminar reminded me of my interests and rekindled my love for computer science. I also attended the Networking and Computer Management seminars held by a current Amazon manager as well as a Google Networking employee. Both those were interesting seminars, however I really fell in love with the computer science presentation. So thats what as of now I am deciding to pursue.</p>

								<h2>Final Reflections</h2>
								<p>Give thoughtful insights about who you are as person and how you see yourself in the face of our society. what do you hope to make of yourself, personally for yourself and more broadly for society and the world. You may consider a Personal Credo or represent. You may also consider explaining how to live your life or explain what legacy you would like to leave(how you want people to remember you).</p>

								<p>Doing this portfolio made me really think about my life as whole. And really made me appreciate myself even more. Looking back from the writing from the beginning of the year too the present, my writing has improved imensly. Its also amazing how incoherent my writing used to be, and now as a graduating junior, my writing has changed, and I have adopted a new style of literature.</p>
